What worked well?
Our website ended up working alright. The previous challenges were helpful for learning the right code.

What didn't/what could go better?
Ideally the website would have been more functional. I could have been a much more helpful and available teammate.

What have you learnt from the collab experience?
I am not very good at communication. 

How was the team project through lockdown?
Exhausting to say the least. I for one am not very good at working from home, too many distractions without a set schedule will allow me to shirk my work.
